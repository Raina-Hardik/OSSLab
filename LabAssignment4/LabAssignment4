1. WAP to print the numpy version in your system and hence,take an input from the user in the form of a list and calculate the frequency of occurrence of each character/integer in that list(count the number of characters).

2. Take a binary input from user and segregate all 1's to left side and 0's to right side.

Ex: Input : 1010011 Output : 111100

3. Write a Python program to remove the nth index character from a nonempty string.
4. Original array:
    [[ 1. 1. 1.]
    [ 1. 1. 1.]
    [ 1. 1. 1.]]

1 on the border and 0 inside in the array
Output:

[[ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]
[ 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.]
[ 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.]
[ 0. 1. 1. 1. 0.]
[ 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.]]

5. Write a Python program to test whether each element of a 1-D array is also present in a second array.
Expected Output:
    Array1: [ 0 10 20 40 60]
    Array2: [0, 40]
    Compare each element of array1 and array2
    [ True False False True False]
6. Write a Python program to find the set exclusive-or of two arrays. Set exclusive-or will return the sorted, unique values that are in only one (not both) of the input arrays.
    Array1: [ 0 10 20 40 60 80]
    Array2: [10, 30, 40, 50, 70]
Unique values that are in only one (not both) of the input arrays: [0 20 30 50 60 70 80]
7. Stack arrays vertically I.e column-wise(hint:use np.column_stack)
8. Take an input matrix from the user and find the rank, trace, determinant of theinput
matrix.
